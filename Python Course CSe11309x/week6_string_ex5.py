# Write a program that asks the user for an input 'n' (assume that the user enters
# a positive integer) and prints only the boundaries of the triangle using asterisks
# "*" of height 'n'. For example if the user enters 6 then the height of the triangle
# should be 6 as shown below and there should be no spaces between the asterisks on
# the top line:
# ******
# *   *
# *  *
# * *
# **
# *

if n > 1:
    print (n*"*") # Print the top line
    for x in range(n-1, 1, -1):
        print("*"+ (x-2)*" "+"*") # Print the middle lines
    print("*") #print the bottom line
elif n == 1:
