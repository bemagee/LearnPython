#  Write a program that asks the user for an input 'n' (assume that the user enters a positive integer) and prints a
# sequence of powers of 10 from 10^0 to 10^n in separate lines. For example if 'n' is equal to 4 then the output should
# look like the following:

#1
#10
#100
#1000
#10000


total = 0

ask = input("enter an integer: ")
entered = int(ask)

for n in range(0, entered + 1):
    print (10**n)
